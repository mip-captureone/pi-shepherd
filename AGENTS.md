# pi-shepherd — maintenance instructions

A no-fuss pi extension for explicit sheep lifecycle orchestration and herding
pi agents inside Herdr. See `README.md` and `docs/dictionary` for terminology
and user-facing usage. The model-facing tool definition is the source of truth
for actions and lifecycle guidance; this file contains repository constraints
only.

## Project conventions

Bundled sheep are `scout`, `planner`, `worker`, and `reviewer`; run only sheep
you trust. `shepherd.md` is the shared fieldnotes index, and each submitted
sheep invocation receives its own note.

## Runtime and architecture

- TypeScript runs directly by pi. There is no build step or bundler.
- Herdr integration shells out to the `herdr` CLI.
- `discovery.ts` is pure and reads agent files fresh on each invocation.
- `orchestration.ts` contains opaque serializable handles and session-scoped
  registries.
- `lifecycle.ts` implements `start`, `prompt`, `wait`, `status`, and `close`.
- `shepherd.ts` exposes the action-discriminated model-facing tool.
- `herdr.ts` owns Herdr launch, pane, and created-pane registry operations.
- `shepherd-done.ts` is the in-tab completion extension.

## Invariants

- Discovery precedence remains user, shared-user, project, shared-project,
  bundled pi agents, bundled shared agents.
- User agent discovery is the default. Project agent definitions are
  repo-controlled and require explicit scope and interactive confirmation.
- Only panes recorded in `~/.pi/agent/pi-shepherd/created-panes.json` may be
  closed by pi-shepherd. Raw pane IDs must not bypass ownership checks.
- Background Herdr placement uses `--no-focus`.
- Temporary launch/session resources are removed only after the child pane is
  confirmed gone.

## Verification

Run `npm test`. Live Herdr verification should cover idle start, non-blocking
prompt, single wait/result recovery, concurrent multi-wait, iterative prompting,
status, close cancellation, focus preservation, and ownership protection.
